# Steganography.xyz
Steganography.xyz is an Android app for steganography.

Steganography is the practice of hiding data within other data.
This app lets you hide text messages in images.

This app was originally developed as an exam project, at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology.
It originally used a web-service for the steganography functionality.
As this web-service is no longer up, I have decided to port the functionality over to the phone itself.
